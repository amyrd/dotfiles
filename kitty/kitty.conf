#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the

#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.
